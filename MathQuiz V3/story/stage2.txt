Well done we have escaped the space pirates
But now we have a new problem.
We didn't check the destination 
of our warp and we ended up next
to a blackhole

Now we are too close to a blackhole.
We have to charge the hyperdrive.
We have to be quick before the blackholes
gravity becomes to much and we can't get away from it.
